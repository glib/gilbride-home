          Welcome to Work From Loam, where code meets mountain adventures. I'm a game developer, parent, and passionate mountain biker trying to balance it all in the beautiful chaos of modern adult life.

          After spending my days building virtual worlds in the video game industry, I find peace and perspective on real mountain trails. This blog explores that intersection – how the problem-solving skills from development translate to technical terrain, how early morning rides fuel creativity for afternoon coding sessions, and how to maintain passions while juggling family responsibilities.
