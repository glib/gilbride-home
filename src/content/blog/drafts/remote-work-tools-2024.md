## The Bottom Line

The best remote work setup is the one your team actually uses consistently. Start with the basics, measure what works, and evolve gradually.

Focus on solving your biggest pain points first—usually communication and development environment consistency—then expand into productivity and culture tools.

Remember: tools are enablers, not solutions. The most sophisticated setup won't fix fundamental team or process issues.
