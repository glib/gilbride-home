## The Trifecta

There is an old adage - strong, cheap, light: pick two. I'm not actually sure where this came from but I bet it wasn't originally related to bikes. Car racing is a likely place but it could just be a generic idea from engineering. Regardless, I do find that it guides a lot of my purchases these days around mountain bike parts.

I never really subscribed to the lightweight aspect of mountain biking. When I started in the late 90s and early 2000s, the 'cool' kids were already bragging about who had a heavier freeride machine. Fourty pound hardtails were common and badges of honor, while everyone knew only the nerdy XC racers worried about lightweight components. Although everyone agreed that titanium was still cool. All the cool people were freeriding, and freeride broke everything, so buying the cheapest and or heaviest parts you could was the way to go. I ran BMX flag pedals and really wanted the Profile cranks that people had figured out how to retrofit to a mountainbike bottom bracket - not that I'd ever broken a BB before but they just looked so cool.

_They honestly still look amazing, just look at that polished steel_

## The interregnum

In the years (alright, nearly decades) that I stopped riding, the freeride community became the downhill and enduro communities, which then both became more focused on racing and once again started to worry about weight. Just as I was coming back into the fold in 2022, there were more and more part failures resulting in downtime, injuries, and missed podiums. People were starting to question whether scraping grams back was worth increasing the chance of failure.

In my time 'away' from the sport, I spent time getting interested in motorcycles, then motorsport in general (cars, tracks, autocross) where these same ideas play out. There's one additional spectrum that things got plotted on there that I see now in MTB, which is the ability for an everyday person to live with something. In motorsport you can find things that work amazingly but require a full rebuilt or replacement after a race, or are completely replaced multiple times over the course of a race or session. The parts perform at an extremely high level, but without professional resources and a team to back them, they're a nightmare to live with for a normal person. There are more consumer-grade options that strike a better balance, maybe 95% of the performance but with a much more tolerant wear or maintenence window that fits with what a normal person can tolerate. I saw the same thing happening with bikes - parts that needed to be tuned in the pits, parts that were completely replaced each race run. Downhillers were still pushing the idea of aluminum rims, but they were also going through a half dozen wheelsets per weekend or more. They were getting brand new chins or brand new whole drivetrains multiple times.
